known the few remaining authentic recorda which are illustrative os

For various aid given in the progness of this work we are also
bound to thank Mr. D'Alton‚ whose accumulated stores of materials
for Irish History are so clearly arranged that they can easily be
· consulted; and for information on topographical subjecta, part of
which unfortunately came too late to be available, the Editor is

indebted to ΜΓ. O'Donovan.
But although much assistance was derived from these and other
scholam, the Editor is chiefly indebted to Dr. Aquilla Smin, who

collated every sheet as it went through the Press with the original,
and exercised a most efficient superintendence over the whole work.
The original document, the fac-simile os which fronts the title

page, is in the Town Clerk's office; it is printed at page 15; but the
word ‘⁶ propensantes,’' line 20, should be “pio pensantes.''
