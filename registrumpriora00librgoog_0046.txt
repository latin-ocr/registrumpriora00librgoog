land⁸. This is a simple and natural arrangement3 it is not easy to
suppose that in an ecclesiasticul Registry any documenta took prece·
dence of the Papal Bulls; and as Archbishop Talbot's¹² relaxation
immediately precedes the confirmation of Pope Gregory‘‚ it is plain
that our present manuscript contains all the Bulls of the original
compilation. It ia, indeed, possible that charters and other evidences
of the connexion of the Priory with the Archbishops of Dublin‚ who
were not only the ordinaries, but the patrons of the house, may have
had the first place in our Registry, und that, instead ofa subsequent
insertion, Archbishop Talbot's Relaxation may have been the last of
a series of such documenta On this matter it is impossible to speak
decisively, but we are of opinion that the original compilation com-
menced with our N o. Ι., aad continued in the order of the following
pageS, until it closed with No, LXXXVIII, and that the numbers
which follow in this collection were added amongst the original com-
pilation, according to the caprice of the transcribere.

Although the misplacing of one⁵ of the Papal bulls, und the mis·
dating of others¹, and the strong suspicion of ut least one graver
error, prevent implicit refrance ou the learning and care of the com-
piler of the Registeu yet of the general accurscy of the record there
is the most satisfactory evidence. Not only is thersa copy of the
deed of Richard Chamberleyn to be found in the Charter Book of
the Corporation of Dublin¹²¹ in the same words with our Nu. XXIX,
but we have in some instances been enabled to test the accu-
