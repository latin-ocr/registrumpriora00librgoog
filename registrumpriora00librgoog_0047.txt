racy of the transcripta in the Register, by collating them with the
original charters. In the muniment room os the Corporation of
Dublin‚ to which access was granted by the hberality of the Cor-
poration, there are still preserved ten documents, the poor remains
of the whole body os the evidences relative to the Priory of All
Hellows‚ which were probably once deposited there. six of these,
os which there is no copy in the Register, have been printed as the
first six numbers of our Appendix. The other four, namely, the
Charter of Adam, Bishop os'Ferns, embodied in the Inspexio of
Edward Ill.¹¹; the Inspexio Confirmacio et Graciosa Concessio of
Richard lI., granted at Kilkenny⁰3 the Confirmation‚ by Almauricus
de Hosda⁹‚ of the Lands of Balidugil and Balylreligan then held by
the canons under the grant os the old Irish kings3 and the Charter os
J ohannes Latimer⁴‚ rehnquishing all claim to that land, “que vocatur
Inchenehaven et jacet inter Duncharni et aquam que vocatur Sohilre·
loth,’' and granting to the Church of All Hallows his own corpse3

these four records have been printed in the following peges, not
from the Register‚ but stom the originale, in the possession of the
Corporation; and the slight difference be'lween these originale and
the copies in the Register, as collated, in the note¹‚ is sufficient evi-
