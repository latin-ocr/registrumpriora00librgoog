of St. John the Evangelist, granted to John Cornyn the privilege
of nominating the Bishop of Glendalough, who was to be chaplain
and vicar to the archbishop. He had previously, when in Dublin¹‚

execution of this plan, although it was confirmed by Matthew¹‚ Arch-
bishop of Cashel, the Pope's Legate3 it is, however, probable that
William Pir0, the last recognizedb Bishop of Glendalough, was ap·
pointed under this charter‚ in 1192. by Arohbishop Comyn.

Pope Innocent 111, to whom John had sent the Arcbbishops of
Bourdeaux‚ Yorlc, and Dublin‚ as ambassadors for the purpose, con-

Loundres founded near the Priory of All-Hallows‚ on the seashore,
which was called the Steyn, an hospital where pilgrimo on their way

weather, should find bed and board; and he endowed there ten
chaplains, who were to wear blaok cloaks with a white cross on
