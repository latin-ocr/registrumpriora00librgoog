The times were now coming when the lands in the immediate
neighbourhood 01 Ι)11111111, although not the most extensive, would be
the most valuable possessione 01 the priory. With shortsighted
polioy¹, Edward the first had wasted the flower of the Anglo·Irish
nobles in the wars 01 Gascony and Scotland, while, with unusual
weakness‚ to secure their favour, he had resisted his own wish to
consolidate his power in lreland, and to attach the natives 101118
government by extending over all the protection and the authority of
English law, and by abrogating altogether those Irish customs, which
‘were still recognized in his conrts. Ι1 18 1101 strange then, that the
nativas, who had in vain sought the 8118118101 the throne from the
oppression 01 their petty tyrants, should have taken advantage 01
the misfortunes 01 Edward II. and should have been encouraged to
resistance by the success 01 the Scots. Nor 18 11 strange that, having
110 0118 great man to guide them, and no principle 01 11111011 10 18188
their discordant septs 1ο the feeling 01 1181101181 independenoe, they
should have satisfied at once their vengeance and their cupidity by
predatory attacks on the property 01 the English, by burning their
homesteads, by driving away their cattle, and finally by entering into
possession 01 the lands, which they had made worthless to the occu-
piers. In this general lawlessness the priory must have found great
difficulty in establishing 118 rights in its remoter estates3 as early 88
1305, we find the prior complaining of a rescue of distresses which
had been made in the feo 01 Tipper·ary¹, 8181101311ι he was par-
