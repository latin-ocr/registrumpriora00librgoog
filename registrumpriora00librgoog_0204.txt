willelmo Boedifi-It is to be secred thet in the nsmes 01 the msyors end provosts,
witnesses to thie lesse, we heve sn instsnoe 01 the carelessness 01 the writer of the
Registry. In Wore's 1111, which wss tslren srom the list in the Tholsel, the msyornnd
bsiliffs 101 this year, 13 34, 111 Willism Gsydon‚ Willism dc Winerton nnd Roger
Grsnoourt ς while 101 the seme year the Chsrter Book 01 the Corporttion, 1016431111

with Wsre. Nor is it, perhaps, impossible to reconcile 111 these seemingly incongruens
nemos, scyron, modis, snd Beydyn, by supposing thet the recl 1111111 wss Becdil',
which being written Begdyv, wcs copied by the scribe in the Cherter Book Beydyn,
snd by the still more 01111111 1111111101 Wsre's list wss changed into chdon. Accord-
ing to this conjecture the renl 1111111 11 more nearly preserved in onr Begistry then in
