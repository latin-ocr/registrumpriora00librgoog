quinquefolio tam scripta quam non scripta, auno Domini 1553, quo·
rum quinquaginta novem sunt scripta'’². Four of the leaves “non
scripta” remain⁵, so that, with the exception of two leaves at the end,
which are now wanting, the manuscriptis as perfect as it was in
15532

Before that time, however, the first sixteen leaves of the original
manuscript were lost, for there are still visible on many of the leaves
the peculiar numerals of au older system of paging, by which the
present folio 1 was nrunbered folio 17. Notwithstanding this muti·
lation of the volume, we may hope that the original Registry is still
nearly complete. It is not likely thatin the early pages, which have
been lost, any of the more ancient docmnents of the Priory were
contained; those peges, probably, were partly occupied hya table of
contenta, such as is frequently prefixed to monastic chartularies3
and partly they may have been left blank for future insertione, like
the folia uon sarapta of the memorandum of 1 ς 5 3; and from Arch-
. bishop Tulbot’s relaxatiou of two marks, payable for proxies, being
written on curfolio 1, it is probable that these early folios were occu·
pied by recorda, to which priority was given, not from their higher
antiquity, but from their peculiar interest in the days of the compiler.
Itis evident that the documents in the Registry have been amanged
according to a system, and this order has, therefore, been preserved
in the following peges: first, there are Papa-l Bulls‘¹, then Royal Cou-
firmations‘, then Charters aud Leases relating to property within the
city of Dublin‘, followed by grants of lands in other parts of Ire-

laud.
