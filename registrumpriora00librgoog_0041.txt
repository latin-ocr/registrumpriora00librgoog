The loyalty os the citizens of Dublin during the siege of Thomas,
Fitzgerald equalling in coinage, ifnot equalling in the importance
of its results, the desence of their predecessore against the attack
of Robert and Edward Bruce, was rewarded with the spoils os
All Hallows. On the 4th os February, 1539, the King granted to
the Mayor, Bailiffs, citizens, and commone of Dublin‚ the Priory‚ with
all its lands and advowsons‚ as they had been surrendered by Prior

Haucoke‚ for the annual payrnent of 24. 4³. offa, as the twentieth
part of the value.

This noble grant was not long held by the Corporation in their
own hands. On 7th of August, 1 5 39, they leasedm the whole of it
for six years, to Nicholas Stanyhurst‚ of Dublin‚ gentleman‚ aud to
Walter Forester, os the same, clerk, at the rent of five score pounds
sterling.

The work os demolition was now going on. In this leuse, although
Stanyhurst was bound to keep up and repair the Byrtas and gate-
house next the Hogge's-green, the stone walls, porter's loge, and leaves
of the same gata, and to uphold the roof thereos, it was covenanted,
that the tenants should make no claim to the stone work, stone walls,
towers‚ dates, and timber, “that is at this present day there unsold
within the precinct of the saidHouse of All Saints,'' and that it should be
lawsul to the Corporation to dispose of thern, and to convey thern away.

Mr. D'Alton mentions an inquisition os 1548, by which All Hal·
lows was found to have been seized of the nunnery or cell os Lusk,

’ which, having been appropriated to the Priory, was afterwards trans·

ferred to Graec Dieu-Hist. of Co. of Dublin‚ 420-42 3. The
