of eny article, there seemed, in the time of this Synod, ιο heve been some doubt ee to
the proper mode of tithing; some esserting thst in such cese no tithes need be peid3
others enjoining, thet if e men hed only one cow, he should divide the price into ten
perte, end give the tenth to God. In the treetise De Stetu Ecclesiae, written ογ Gilbert,

Bishop of Limerick end Legete, about the yeer 1100, ere these words, shewing the
peyment of tithee, end the persons ιο whom they were peid in Irelend et thet time:

“ Octo sunt ergo quibus sustentatur sacerdos, parochie mensus, atrium, coemiterium,
templum, altere, calix cum patene, eorpus cum sanguine, ....... Perochiem appello
populum primitias oblationes et decimos persolventem, Mansum dico terrem aratri

petition of orders for their peymcnt by Cerdinsl Pepero in 1157 (see the Annels of
Cluein Aidnech, in Keeting, vol. ii p. 276), et the Council of Ceehel in 1 172, in which,

bremis-who, however, mixes this cherge with others which, es Irishmen, we should
not willingly ellow (Top. Hib. Distinc. iii. c. 19)-thet there wes some difficulty in en·

Except in the peyment of the querter episcopale ιο the bishops in Conneught (see
