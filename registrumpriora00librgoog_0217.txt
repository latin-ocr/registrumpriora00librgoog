pert of Drcghede, ou the North side of the Boyne, was called De Ponte ex perte Uriel,
or, De Ponte Ferrardi, from its situation iu the territory of Ferrerd. In thia North
part of Drcghede was situated the Francisceu Friary of Drogheds, where were com-
piled the Annus de PonteFerrardi, celled hitherto Annales de Monte Fernandi, or the
Annels of Multiferuam.—See note following.

Pege 66, line 20.

De Penta—lt would now be difficult to discover the reasons why the Annels in·
scribed “Annales de Monte Feruaudi,” were celled the Annals of Multifernem.

There is no reason for beliering thet the Franciacau Friary of Multifernam was
ever called de Monte Feruendi, a neme, which its situation in a low velley would ren·
der singularly inapplicable. Multifernem wes founded by the Delamars, aname which
does not occur in the Annals de Monte Fernandi; end these Aunnls mehe frequent
mention of families whom we cannot trace in the neighbourhood of Multifernem.
These obvious objections ιο the common title, aud the frequent mention of the family
of Dexter, induced Ware, and Usher‚ end Molyneux, ιο suspect thet these Anuels
were compiled in the Dominiceu Friery of Stratie, in Meyo. This suppositiou would
do away altogether with the common title, end is inconsistent with the evidence con-
tained in the Annals that they were the work of a Franciscan. By the change of only

two letters iu the title ell difficulties may be overcome. That pert ofDrogheda which
lies on the north side of the Boyne, in the Berony of Ferrard, was called De Ponte
Ferrerdi, to distinguish it from the villa De Ponte on the south side of the river.-

D’Alton‚ vol i. p. 146. On this, the north side of the Boyne, wes situated the Fran-
ciscau Frinry of Droghede, end it mey be assumed that this friury was called de Ponte
Ferrardi, as long as the distinction between the two sides of the river was continued3
and thet this name became obsolete when both boroughs were consolidated. If these
Annals were compiled in Droghedn the frequentanti familiar mention of the Dextera,
the Lords of Stechellan (D’Altou, vol. i. p. 90), aud the builders of Castle Dexter, and
the namers of Carrig Dexter, is easily accouutedfor; eudasthe Dextersof Meeth were
most probably connected with the Dexters or the Jordan of Connaught, the notices of
Connnught uffeirs may be traced ιο the seme origin. Although, for convenient reference,
these Annals may still be quoted es the Annels of Multiferuen, hy which neme they
here been called by Uasher, Ware, N icolson‚ and Smith, wc think thet their proper
title is “Annales de Ponte Ferrardi‚’' end that the Franciscan Frinry of Drogheda is
entitled to the honour of their compilation
