time that Theobald Fitzwalter, second butler of Ireland, granted to
the priory two acres and a half of his land of Steyn near to their
house, with all the tithes and offerings of the whole Steyn3 and that
John, son of John, son of Dermic', confirmed his father's grant ofa
boat for catching salmon and other fish on the Liffey, for which he
was to receive a rose on every St John Baptist's day, in the Church
of All-Hallows; and it was probably about the same time that Clari·
cia‘, daughter of Gilbert, son of Griffin, granted halfa carucata of
unable land in Balyofryn next to the land of Sir John Harold ol
Kylgabane (Kilgobbin)‚ with pasture on the mountains foras many
cattle as the canons chose, with hberty to pastura, dig, cut, and with
all other privileges, which the grantor possessed or could give.

and the other grants of the same period, there is proof-in the men-

Norman settlers brought with them into Ireland all the complexities
of the feudal system, a system eminently fitted, by the strictness
and frequency of its legal relatione, by the minute divisione of its
ever present authority, by the neamess of its administrators, and by
the variety and succession os its dependencies, to discipline arude
peoplc by the introduction ol notions of right and of laW, and by
famiharizing them with legal forms and ceremonies. Nor, when we are
considering a great ecclesiastica] lordship, should we forget that the
