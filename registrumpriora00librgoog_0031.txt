writ⁹ of Richard II. ordering the observance of the enactment in the
statute of Kilkenny, that no Irishman, or any enemy of the king,
should be admitted into any religious house within the landos Ire-
land. Reoourse had often been had before, by both sides, to this
'unhappy proos of national discord. So early as 1250 Pope Innocent
IV.‘¹ sent a Bull to the Irish bishops, ordering them to revokca
Statutc which they had made, “ ex quodam livore,'’ that no English-
man should he received into their religione houses as a canon: and
while the lrish Abbot of Mellilont' refused to admit any monk unless
he made oath that he was not of English descent and the Irish
Abbot of Magio⁸ [Mayo] alienated the lands of his ahbey witha view
to prevent English monks from dwelling there, the English monks of
Granardt and of lniscouroy, of the same Order (they were all Cis-
tercians)‚ buckled on their armour and attached and killed the Irish,
and then returned to celebrate Mass

The writ os Richard ΙΙ. was directed to twenty-one religione
houses; although not repealed by authority, it was not long observed;
like many other laws it was silently reversed when the passion in
which it originated had given place to the common seelings of hu-
manity. The names of some of the subsequent abbots in these

houses are purely* Irish.
